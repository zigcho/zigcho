# third party notices

zigcho's original work is covered by the Zigcho Public Use License in `LICENSE`.
everything listed below keeps its own copyright and licence. this file does not
grant rights to the osu! or ppy names, game resources, beatmaps, music, user
uploads or other third-party art.

the separate `zigcho/zigcho-anticheat-private` module is not covered by the
Zigcho Public Use License. it is proprietary under the Zigcho Anticheat Access
License and may only be accessed or used by people and systems given explicit
permission by raya. repository or binary access on its own is not a licence to
use, copy, modify, distribute, deploy or share it.

## related client work

the pinned client patch and its complete notices now live in
[`zigcho/zigcho-lazer`](https://github.com/zigcho/zigcho-lazer). official osu!
client code is not copied or linked into this server repository.

the server is still checked against the official [`ppy/osu`](https://github.com/ppy/osu)
client, which is MIT-licensed:

- Copyright (c) 2025 ppy Pty Ltd <contact@ppy.sh>
- license: [MIT](https://github.com/ppy/osu/blob/12df2e4ff254975f4b66ae9efda808837ee9beea/LICENCE)

ppy's MIT licence covers client code, not the osu!/ppy branding or game
resources.

## PP bridge

the local Rust bridge in `pp/` links these direct dependencies:

| component | pinned version | license | upstream |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rosu-pp` for Stable | `4.0.1` | MIT, Copyright (c) 2021 Max | [MaxOhn/rosu-pp](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp) |
| `rosu-pp` for lazer parity | `5.0.0` at `1129a7e79d689fc705bf93fb2f2a6411825ba545` | MIT, Copyright (c) 2021 Max | [kaibi-dev/rosu-pp](https://github.com/kaibi-dev/rosu-pp) |
| `akatsuki-pp` | `1.1.2` at `591de0db4948f2c504ca6e2ca3db442f09103ef1` | MIT, Copyright (c) 2021 Max | [osuAkatsuki/akatsuki-pp-rs](https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/akatsuki-pp-rs) |
| `rosu-map` | `0.2.1` | MIT, Copyright (c) 2024 MaxOhn | [MaxOhn/rosu-map](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-map) |
| `rosu-mods` | `0.2.1` and `0.4.1` | MIT, Copyright (c) 2024 Badewanne3 | [MaxOhn/rosu-mods](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-mods) |
| `serde_json` | `1.0.149` | MIT or Apache-2.0; Zigcho uses the MIT option | [serde-rs/json](https://github.com/serde-rs/json) |

`pp/Cargo.lock` is the exact inventory for the bridge's transitive Rust
dependencies. those crates remain under the license files published with each
crate; Zigcho does not relicense them.

## browser replay playback

the website bundles [`replayviewer-js` 1.0.0](https://github.com/daladal/replayviewer-js) in
`src/web/vendor/replayviewer/` for local browser playback. its code is MIT,
Copyright (c) 2026 bog; the complete notice is kept next to the bundled files.
zigcho generates its own basic playback skin at runtime and does not ship the
sample skin, sample maps or osu! resource assets from that project.

## protocol references

Stable protocol and achievement compatibility reference the MIT-licensed
[`osuAkatsuki/bancho.py`](https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/bancho.py) project —
Copyright (c) 2019 cmyui. bancho.py is not bundled or linked into Zigcho.
